## 📁 Project Overview

This project analyzes telecom customer churn to understand why customers leave and identify retention strategies. The dataset contains demographic, subscription, billing, and service-related information.

---

## 🧹 Step 1 — Data Cleaning (Python)

Tasks performed:
- Removed missing values
- Converted data types
- Engineered `tenure_group` column
- Exported cleaned dataset

---

## 🔍 Step 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

Key findings:
- Overall churn rate: ~26%
- Minor differences observed across contract type, gender, and internet service plan
- No strong churn driver found in categorical breakdowns

---

## 🛢 Step 3 — SQL Analysis

SQL queries performed:
- Churn rate analysis
- Churn by contract type, payment method, tenure, and internet service
- Identification of high-risk customer profiles
